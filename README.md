# AutoRSTEM
A tool for the automated analysis of HAADF STEM images. The general flow of the analysis is given in imganalscript.py, but the individual files can be used independently depending on the analysis. fftcompression.py is used to determine the smallest radius, or half separation distance between features of the image for further steps in the process. rsicompression.py identifies features and sandwichsmooth.py reduces noise based on a specified distance. lonelattice.py will connect a set of points based on proximity to one another to form a lattice, refine their position, and provide information about the connections. pointfitting.py contains methods used by lonelattice to refine feature positions. latticeanalysis.py takes the information provided by lonelattice.py and transforms it into a useful form for further analysis.
